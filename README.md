# PC Hardware Eshop
This is a projected i did in the first 6 months in college and its very simple and mostly uses html but wanted to post it here either way so i have a collection of the projects i do.

basically this is a a purely front end focused web application and its theme is an hardware Eshop where customers should be able to create an account and start orders for the different types of hardware available.

i would like to comeback to this project when possible and improve it by using the experiences and technologies i have learned now.
